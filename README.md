# mission-0-L5

Recently I completed a 3 hour course on Tailwind CSS on Scrimba.

During the course we built this responsive layout for a "Learn Tailwind CSS" landing page based on a Figma design file. 

I will be taking this recently completed project and using it as a template for the first "Mission" during my level 5 course and customising the layout to fit the design 
brief/wireframe.
